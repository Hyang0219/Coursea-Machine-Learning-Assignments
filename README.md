# Coursea-Machine-Learning-Assignments

## Reference
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

I have saved all my **own solutions** to all the programming assignments from the course in this Repo.
I have coded from scratch for most of the assignments, in my own way, instead of following the pre-coded templates.
If you are reading this repo, I strongly suggest you do the same as well. You will not only obtain a lot deeper understanding of how each of the algorithm works, but also sharpen a little bit more on realising multivariate calculus with coding in Matlab.

If you ever get stuck with the assignment, feel free to explore my answers but you might find it is very different from the templates.

This is a very good introductory course into machine learning at a very foundation level. After completing it, you will find a lot easier to interpret and apply the modern ML libraries at a high level.
